# Brightness Indicator

An Ubuntu Indicator App for setting screen brightness through `xandr`. Useful when the default
drivers or whatever don't work.

# Usage

Depends on `xandr` and `python3`

Simply download these files and run `brightness.py`.

If you want to always have access to it, set the script executable and add it to your startup
applications.
